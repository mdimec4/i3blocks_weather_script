This script will add weather info to your i3bar, of
your i3 Windows manager.


This is my modifications of the original script, which was done by Anachron. All thanks goes to him.
Original can be found here: https://github.com/Anachron/i3blocks/tree/master/blocks
Script is based on API: http://openweathermap.org/current



## configure

Script relies on custom i3 status line called i3blocks.
For more info and how to install it see: https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks

Add to your ~/.i3blocks.conf
#weather
[weather]
instance=3196359
interval=60

Instance number is City id for which you want to show weather.

To find your city id see 'city.list.json.gz',
which can be downloaded here: http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/


You will allso need to register with "http://openweathermap.org",
to get a free private API key. Without it, script wont work.
